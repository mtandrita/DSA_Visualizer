# DSA Visualizer

Interactive visualizations of fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms, built to help learners understand how they work step by step.

[👉 Live Demo](https://mtandrita.github.io/DSA_Visualizer/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive visualizations** of key data structures:
  - Arrays  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Stacks  
  - Queues  
  - Trees  
  - Sorting algorithms  
- **Step-by-step execution**: See how each operation is performed under the hood (insertions, deletions, traversal, etc.).
- **User-friendly UI**: Clean and intuitive design so both beginners and advanced users can follow along.
- **Educational tool**: Ideal for students, self-learners, and anyone preparing for interviews or wanting to solidify their understanding of DSA.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

- Many learners struggle with abstract concepts in DSA; visual tools help make those ideas concrete.
- By watching structures evolve and algorithms proceed, it's easier to build intuition, debug mental models, and retain concepts.
- It’s a hands-on, exploratory way to learn — you control what step you see, which operations to try, and when to pause and understand.

## 🔧 What’s Inside / How It Works

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Array visualizer | View static & dynamic changes in arrays (e.g. indexing, updates) |
| Linked List viewer | Insert, delete, traverse ‒ see how nodes link/unlink |
| Stack & Queue modules | Push/pop, enqueue/dequeue operations with visual cues |
| Tree module | Visualize tree construction, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) |
| Sorting visualizations | Watch classic sorting algorithms in action (e.g. bubble sort, mergesort) |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS** for layout and styling  
- **JavaScript** for logic and DOM manipulation  
- (Optionally: mention any frameworks or libraries if you used any, e.g. D3.js, React, etc.)  
- Fully client-side, so no server setup needed — just open in browser or visit via GitHub Pages.

## 📚 How to Use

1. Open the live site → [DSA Visualizer](https://mtandrita.github.io/DSA_Visualizer/)  
2. Select a data structure or algorithm from the menu.  
3. See visualization of operations. Use control buttons (if any) to play, pause, step-through, or reset.  
4. Experiment! Try different inputs (if supported) to see behavior.

## 💡 Possible Extensions / Future Work

- Add more algorithms (e.g. graph algorithms, dynamic programming visualizations)  
- Support custom input (e.g. user-entered arrays, tree shapes)  
- Speed / performance control (slow / fast mode)  
- Improved responsive design for smaller screens or mobile devices  
- Animations & transitions to further clarify state changes
